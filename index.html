             <p>Reflection <br /> 
                In order to do the review, I went to different tutorial videos and videos from the previous weeks.<br />
                In the rock game exercise I had much more difficulties than the previous times I couldn't finish it.
                I just hope the midterm isn't complicated like the rock game.
